## Installing and Setting up Git 

*GitHub is a website that allows for project sharing. A repository is created and 
files are added to the “main” or “develop” branch. Branches can be made off of other 
branches and each branch contains changes to the project that can be merged, called a 
pull request, into the parent branch by the owner(s) of the repository. Anyone who has
the project can easily pull changes made by other collaborators by using the `git pull` 
command.*
1. Open and follow the instructions on the site
   up: https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home
2. For more information: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

## Installing Git Bash (Windows) and Generating an SSH key 

*Note: Git Bash (step 1 - 3) is only required for Windows. For Mac or Linux use default shell or 
shell of choice, go to step 4*

1. Download GIT bash from https://git-scm.com/downloads  (follow the installer, defaults 
   are ok) if it's not already on your machine
    + To check if it’s already on your machine, go to the start button and type git, 
      “Git Bash” should come up in the window.
2. Open a Git Bash window:
3. Follow step 1.A, and click to open a window
4. Use the command: `cd ~/.ssh`
5. Run the command: `ls`
6. Run the command: `ssh-keygen -o`

```javascript
PS C:\Users\YourUser> ssh-keygen -o
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (C):
Created directory 'C:\Users\YourUser/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in C:\Users\YourUser.
Your public key has been saved in C:\Users\YourUser/.ssh.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:8dvoBlfJDSSVqwAfVFQwzx7LOJWApbCWBMH9y/xwlPc azuread\youruser@USER-LT
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|       ++oOB+.   |
|      o... B+    |
|       o..+.+*  .|
|   o.o +oB o=.o.o|
|      + S.+o.o  o|
|        ..o+  = E|
|         oo .  + |
|         ..     .|
|         ..      |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

7. Run the command: `ls`
8. Run the command:  `cat ~/.ssh/<file name>`
   + Copy the entire output
9. If more help is needed: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key
10. Open GitHub, login, and go to your settings
11. On the left side there is a tab titled: `SSH and GPG keys`
12. Click: `New SSH Key`
13. Copy the output from Step 7 and create a name for this key
14. Upon completion, you will need to enter your password to confirm
    
### Use Git Bash in IntelliJ
 
*Recommended for Windows users to wish to use Git Bash as their terminal in IntelliJ* 

15. Open IntelliJ, go to File > Settings 
16. Search for "Terminal"
17. Change "Shell Path" to where you installed Git Bash in step 1, for example 
    `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`
    
## Cloning a Repository

1. Go to the repository you just created 
2. On the Code drop down menu, select SSH and copy the text
3. In your IDE, open the terminal on the bottom.
   + Run: `cd Users\[your id]`
   + Run the command: `git clone [copied text]`
4. If successful, you should see the following: 

```javascript
$ git clone <link>
Cloning into '<YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME>'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 30, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (30/30), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (29/29), done.
remote: Total 30 (delta 7), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (30/30), 1.79 MiB | 2.54 MiB/s, done.
```

4. To Verify, Go to the directory in File Explorer and `<YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME>` should 
   be a new folder

## Creating Changes and Creating a Pull Request:

1. Open the README file
2. Within this file change the name to reflect the name of your Repository
3. Write a description for this repository 
4. Open the terminal in IntelliJ
   + Run the code: `git branch sampleBranch`
      + This creates the branch sampleBranch, which is currently a copy of the master or main
       branch
   + Run the code: `git checkout sampleBranch`
      + This allows you to make your changes to this new branch, to verify this worked check 
        the highlighted portion of your IDE. If it doesn’t say sampleBranch something went wrong
5. On the left middle side there should be 3 tabs, hit the **Commit** Tab.
6. Select the README, type a commit message, and hit **Commit and Push** and hit **Push** 
   when the window pops up
7. Go to your repository in your web browser to make sure the branch was updated and then 
   hit **Compare and Request** to create a Pull Request
